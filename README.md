# 🚀 StartHub: Revolutionizing Startup Management

## 🌟 Ignite Your Startup Ecosystem

StartHub is not just another web application – it's the beating heart of your startup community. Streamline, track, and supercharge your startups' journey from inception to success!

## 📜 Project Description

StartHub is a cutting-edge web application designed to revolutionize how startup ecosystems are managed. Built on the powerful MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), StartHub offers a comprehensive solution for startup incubators, accelerators, and innovation hubs.

- **Startup KYC** (Know Your Customer) management
- **Real-time progress tracking**
- **Monthly report collection and analysis**

From the moment a startup joins your ecosystem to its graduation and beyond, StartHub provides the tools and insights needed to nurture success and drive innovation.
